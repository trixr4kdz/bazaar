<!-- This is a simple, bare-bones canvas web page template.
     Its sole purpose is to save you a little typing when
     starting up a new web page that uses the canvas element. -->

    <title>Edit the title of this canvas page!</title>

  <body>
    <!-- No further elements here; strictly minimalist.
         But of course you may resize your canvas as needed. -->
    <canvas id="canvas" width="512" height="512">
      Sorry, but you need a web browser that supports the
      <code>canvas</code> element.

         rename and edit this file. -->
